# # Unlimited scrolling in google and save the output in the excel file
#This Python script uses Playwright to perform web scraping on Google Search results for a given set of URLs related to "artificial intelligence." The collected data is then processed and saved to an Excel file using Pandas.
Getting Started
Prerequisites
Python 3.x
Playwright library
Rich library
Pandas library
pip install playwright rich pandas
Script Overview
The script launches a Playwright browser, navigates to specified URLs, and performs interactions on the Google Search results page.
It utilizes the Rich library for enhanced console output.
Data is collected by locating and extracting text content from specific div elements on the page.
The script simulates user actions like pressing the 'End' key and clicking on a specific element multiple times to load additional content.
Collected data is processed and saved to an Excel file (output.xlsx) using Pandas.
Customization
Modify the urls_to_process list to include the desired URLs for scraping.
Adjust the interaction logic and selectors in the process_page function based on the structure of the target web page.
Notes
The script introduces delays to ensure page content is loaded before interactions.
Headless mode is set to False in Playwright to allow for visual debugging.
The script is designed for educational purposes and may require adjustments for production use.
